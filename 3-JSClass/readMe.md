# Payment System Using JavaScript Classes

In this assignment, you will practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript by creating and using a class.

## Instructions:
1. Create a Payment class in JavaScript
In scripts.js, create a class called Payment. Each payment must have the following properties:
•	payerName
•	amount
•	method (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal)
•	date
You must use a constructor to initialize these properties.

2. Add methods to the class
Inside the Payment class, create the following methods:
•	getSummary(): Returns a string describing the payment (payer name, amount, and method)
•	isLargePayment(): Returns true if the amount is greater than 100, otherwise returns false

3. Create Payment objects
Create at least 3 payment objects using the new keyword.
•	Payment from Alice
•	Payment from John
•	Payment from Sarah
